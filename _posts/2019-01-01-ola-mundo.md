In the week following the alien attack in Lisbon, we've seen an uprising in the defense of the world by none other than the Gummy Bear people, lead by Jelly Dad.
Having succeeded in eliminating the aliens from the interior of the city, the gummy bear army is now cleansing the surrounding cities and regions.
The world is grateful to the Gummy Bear People for saving us from eternal doom.
