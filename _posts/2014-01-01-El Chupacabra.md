An experiment, as a part of a workshop that had as objective of recreating the point of view of an animal. A recreation of the point of view of a mexican mythological animal, El Chupabra (The Goatsucker, in english). Worked in multiple parts of this project, primarily in making most of the sound effects (the breathing, the clicking noise, and the drums, pe.) and also in assisting on the recording and on the editing.
