# Jo√£o Firmo - Jekyll

Based on the theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), but with a completely different styling.

Used technologies:

_HTML for the whole website

_SCSS for most of the website, had to resort to basic CSS on some areas due to some errors I couldn't fix in SCSS

_Responsive Web Design for all of the website, the mobile page is as clean as the main one

_Jekyll for the whole website

_GitHub for the whole development, which I really loved and will use a lot in the future

_Grids for the images in the home page

_Flexbox for a lot of items in the website

_Forms for the contact form

_Animations for the home page
